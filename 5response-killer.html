                <p>If youâ€™re ready this article youâ€™ve probably tried LinkedIn outreach already (great! ðŸ˜‰), but you
                    might have experienced a low connection acceptance rate or a low response rate to your messages.</p>
                <p>Donâ€™t give up! Mastering your cold approach on LinkedIn is not as easy as it seems, but with a little
                    bit of learning you can start killing it.</p>
                <p>Today weâ€™re going to talk about the thing no one wants to hear, your mistakes! But hey, everyone
                    makes some mistakes when trying to figure out the best process, and I can tell you that I made
                    plenty myself.</p>
                <img src="images/blog/Picture16.gif" alt="" class="in-post">
                <p>Letâ€™s focus on the top 5 things that kill your response rate on LinkedIn.</p>

                <div class="table-contents">
                    <p>Table of Contents</p>
                    <a href="#n1">1. Having an incomplete profile</a><br>

                <a name="n1"></a>
                <h3>1. Having an incomplete profile</h3>
                <p>Thatâ€™s the very first thing you need to worry about. Your profile is the first thing people see on
                    LinkedIn when interacting with you, itâ€™s your LinkedIn identity.</p>
                <p>Itâ€™s extremely important to build trust right away by having a complete and up to date profile, and
                    even more, itâ€™s important that your profile communicate your value as a connection, what you have to
                    offer.</p>
                <p>First you need to have a photo of yourself (not your company logo, not your cat or dog, and not you
                    skiing), make it as professional as you can â€“ respecting your industry codes of course, youâ€™re not
                    going to rock a navy suit and tie if youâ€™re working at a start-up, or a Star Wars t-shirt if youâ€™re
                    in banking.</p>
                <img src="images/blog/Picture17.gif" alt="" class="in-post">
                <p>You might also want to add a background picture, ideally this picture should describe what you do in
                    just a few words, and include at least one CTA. CTAs can aim to get your profile viewers to
                    subscribe to a newsletter, follow you or your page, anything that can make them show interest.</p>
                <p>Hereâ€™s an example of my own profile (â€˜what you do says more than what you sayâ€™ ðŸ˜Š)
                </p>
                <img src="images/blog/Picture18.png" alt="" class="in-post">
                <p>The photo is quite professional, the background picture is simple with three ideas I wanted to
                    communicate, and the CTAs are on the right pointing to the bottom to the page for more information.
                </p>
                <p>Once youâ€™ve spend some time perfecting your image, you can now focus on the text part of your profile
                    â€“ for the lengthâ€™s sake Iâ€™m not going to dive into too much details here.</p>


                <a name="n2"></a>
                <h3>2. Not spending enough time targeting</h3>
                <p>Targeting is such a big part of the success of a marketing strategy. Not being prepared enough when
                    launching campaigns is often detrimental and leads to poor results, which makes no one happy.</p>
                <p>There are two main thing we need to focus on when engaging on LinkedIn, the first one is to <a
                        href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/target-market/">identify
                        your target audience</a> and to <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/buyer-persona/">create your
                        buyer persona</a> and the second is to use LinkedIn to target
                    this audience.
                </p>
                <p>LinkedIn offers plenty of ways to search for profile to target, but you must spend time thinking
                    about the best way to reach your target audience.
                </p>
                <p>The search engine on the platform is a great place to start â€“ you can use a variety of filters to
                    extract profiles that match your audience. </p>
                <p>You can also target profile by their activity, which is a level of targeting above. For example, you
                    can contact people who are in a certain LinkedIn group, who post content or even who engage with
                    content! </p>

                <a name="n3"></a>
                <h3>3. Using generic copywriting</h3>
                <p>If your LinkedIn profile is the face of your marketing campaign, the copywriting is certainly its
                    heart.</p>
                <p>What you have to say and how you say it is what drives your responses, itâ€™s also true for every
                    marketing channel, but itâ€™s even more true for LinkedIn. Users are literally bombarded with generic
                    messages, itâ€™s always pretty much the same format and thereâ€™s next to no personalisation.</p>
                <p>Donâ€™t do that.</p>
                <p>Your messages should always sound authentic and natural, not like they were sent for the 1500th time.
                </p>
                <p>To do that, try to make the message about what you share with the person youâ€™re contacting, avoid
                    making it all about yourself and your business, but rather about how you can add value to one
                    another.</p>
                <p>A good way to have a good response rate is to base your outreach on a common ground, something your
                    prospect and you can relate to. The aim is to be linked to something that interests your target so
                    you can be associated with it. </p>

                <a name="n4"></a>
                <h3>4. Making mistakes while using automation</h3>
                <p>Now your profile is spotless, your targeting is on point and your copywriting could get anyone to
                    respond to your connection request or message. But, it still takes a long time to send all these one
                    by one, and frankly youâ€™re not going to spend all day doing this.</p>
                <p>So how do we scale this? Donâ€™t worry, we have the solution for you! ðŸ˜‰</p>
                <p>You can automate these tasks on LinkedIn by using our service -> <a
                        href="https://www.reachly.io">hereâ€™s where itâ€™s happening.</a></p>
                <p>LinkedIn automation is fantastic, we can agree on that. But we need to be careful as some mistakes
                    can reduce all your efforts to zero.</p>
                <img src="images/blog/Picture19.gif" alt="" class="in-post">
                <p>These mistakes can be related to format â€“ for instance, your placeholders arenâ€™t working properly and
                    youâ€™re sending â€˜Hi {{first_name}â€™ to a bunch of contacts (guilty), your link leads to a dead end, or
                    thereâ€™s a horrible typo that the 500 people youâ€™re targeting will see but not you, etc.
                </p>
                <p>They can also be related to process â€“ the time frames havenâ€™t been properly entered and you end up
                    sending messages at 2am on a Saturday.</p>
                <p>This can happen to anyone, but if you let the pros do it for you, your chance of getting it right
                    dramatically increase ðŸ˜‰.</p>

                <a name="n5"></a>
                <h3>5. Getting flagged by LinkedIn</h3>
                <p>The last thing that kills your response rate on LinkedIn is getting flagged. But what does it mean?
                </p>
                </p>It means LinkedIn thinks youâ€™re a spammer or youâ€™re attempting to send fishing messages. This
                happens when you use automation in the wrong way possible and contact everyone and anyone. It happens
                also when your targeting hasnâ€™t been set and you start sending
                waves of messages and requests that arenâ€™t accepted.</p>
                <p>The algorithm then thinks your outreach is undesirable to LinkedIn users and flags you.</p>
                <p>In practice, it looks like this:</p>
                <img src="images/blog/Picture20.png" alt="" class="in-post">
                <p>When you click on â€˜Viewâ€™, it triggers this:</p>
                <img src="images/blog/Picture21.png" alt="" class="in-post">
                <p>This is an awful example of LinkedIn outreach, and Iâ€™m not surprised they were flagged as spam. There
                    is no targeting, and zero personalization whatsoever. Iâ€™m pretty sure the response rate here was
                    close to nothing (not even talking about the subscriptions!). </p>
                <p>But donâ€™t worry if you stick to the best practices and apply the tips weâ€™ve been giving you, this
                    should never happen to you!</p>
