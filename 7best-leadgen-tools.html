                <h3>6. LinkedIn Sales Navigator</h3>
                <img src="images/blog/Picture12.png" alt="" class="in-post">
                <p>Sales Navigator is a must have to effectively search LinkedIn’s user base. It’s targeted at
                    salespeople, but really is useful to anyone who’s into growth and getting more leads.</p>
                <p>It allows you to browse LinkedIn’s user base with extensive filters to find the leads you’re really
                    looking for. You can then save those searches and build lists of leads to be targeted! </p>
                <img src="images/blog/Picture13.png" alt="" class="in-post">
                <p>Sales navigator also comes with a dedicated inbox and some great features. One of my personal
                    favourites is the ‘Technology’ filter that you can use to find companies that use a specific
                    technology, which is great to target your ideal audience!</p>
                <p>You can get a decent acceptance rate with this strategy, personally I average 64%.
                </p>
