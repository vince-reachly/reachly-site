            <h2>5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
            <p>In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>
            <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store
                information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain
                cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>

            <h2>6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
            <p>In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have
                access to certain information about you.</p>
            <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or
                that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Website. Please note that we do not control, and
                are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media
                provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and
                share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
            </p>

            <h2>7. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2>
            <p>In Short: We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.</p>
            <p>Our servers are located in the United Kingdom. If you are accessing our Website from outside , please be
                aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by
                those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE
                SHARED WITH ANYONE?" above), in and other countries.</p>
            <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data
                protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take
                all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and
                applicable law.</p>

            <h2>8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this
                privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
            <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in
                this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal
                information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
                delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
                information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
                and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

            <h2>9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
            <p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical
                security measures.</p>
            <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
                security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure
                your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
                guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
                unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access,
                steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
                transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access
                the Website within a secure environment.</p>

            <h2>10. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
            <p>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
            <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Website,
                you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and
                consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Website. If we learn that personal information from users
                less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
                measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have
                collected from children under age 18, please contact us at info@reachly.io </p>

            <h2>11. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
            <p>In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have rights that allow you greater
                access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account
                at any time.</p>
            <p>In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data
                protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
                information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal
                information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have
                the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use
                the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with
                applicable data protection laws.</p>
            <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw
                your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing
                before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
                reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
            <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your
                personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory
                authority. You can find their contact details here:
                http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.</p>
            <p>If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are

                "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make

                such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice
                frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
